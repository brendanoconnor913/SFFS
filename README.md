# Specification
Implement Sequential Forward Floating Selection
(SFFS)
Scheme
as a 
wrapper 
to obtain optimum features for the spoof detector.


Abstract

A spoof detector is a 
two
-
class
classifier that distinguishes live samples from the fake 
artifacts.
Two  type  of  f
eatures
namely  local  binary  patterns  (
LBP
)
and  Binary  Gabor  Patterns 
(BGP)
have been  extracted from live  and fake fingerprint images from  LivDet 2011 fingerprint 
spoof dataset
captured using 
Digital fingerprint sensor
.
Support Vector Machine
(
SVM
)
classifier 
is used to train and validate the spoof detector
.
